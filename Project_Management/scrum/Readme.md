# SCRUM

* Scrum is a development Framework that adheres to the Agile Development methodology. Agile is based on the iterative incremental software development model.

## Methodology Vs. Framework

* A **methodology** is a set of principles, tools and practices which can be used to guide processes to achieve a particular goal.

* A **framework** is a loose but incomplete structure which leaves room for other practices and tools to be included but provides much of the process required.

* If we look at the software equivalents, for instance, where applications are analogous to methodologies: Rails and Spring are two code-based frameworks which work with custom code to produce an application. GMail is an application.

* In the same way, Scrum could be considered a framework, as it leaves room for teams to choose their own technical processes, development roles, etc. Agile might be considered a methodology, as it provides guidelines for all the same things that Scrum does, along with relevant technical practices.

## Definition of the Technical Debt

Technical debt is a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution.

Technical debt is commonly associated with extreme programming, especially in the context of refactoring. That is, it implies that restructuring existing code (refactoring) is required as part of the development process. Under this line of thinking refactoring is not only a result of poorly written code, but is also done based on an evolving understanding of a problem and the best way to solve that problem.

* Technical debt may also be known as design debt.
