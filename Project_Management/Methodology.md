# Project Methodology

There are several project management methodology that are prevalent for managing projects like

* **Waterfall Model:** Waterfall model is based on the incremental model. In this method, the project is planned from top to bottom at once. The whole project will be divided into seven consecutive phases. In this method, all the features are delivered at once at the end of the cycle

* **Agile:** In this method the process design is broken into individual models. The development process is iterative, and the end of each iteration, shippable features of the product are delivered to the customer Learn more about Agile Model here

* **PRINCE 2:** It is a general project management methodology and can be used for a project of any scale. It is a process-oriented approach with each process having inputs and outputs, tasks and activities to complete

* **RAD:** Rapid application development is a project management methodology used for software development, where the main purpose of developing application faster with high quality. The whole development process is defined into four phase

* **Kanban:** In Kanban methods, a board is used on which sticky notes are placed in the column as per the status of the task. The common status used for project task include "in queue", "in progress" and "recently completed."

* **Six Sigma:** The six sigma are preferred for a project that needs precise measure. It uses the statistics to improve processes and minimize defects in a product or service. It uses two different sets of methodologies DMAIC and DMADV

* **SDLC:** SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) is a generic approach to project management which cover basic project management concepts like needs analysis, design, training, delivery, and support

* **Extreme Programming (XP):** XP is frequently used for IT project management. Like scrum, XP also works in iteration but their iteration duration is usually short. The scope within each iteration is flexible as long as the work is not started

* **Crystal Methodology:** This method is quite supportive for fixed price contracts. Iterations in crystal method are released regularly. This method can detect any flaws in the early stage of the project, and errors are less likely to occur.

* **CCPM (Critical Chain Project Management):** This method reduce activity duration time by 50% hence project can be finished early. It uses buffer management to control the plan and ensures minimum error.
