**Agility is about Business Value Increments not development Cycles**

# Definition

Agile development at the team or small organization level has emerged over the last 20 years as a really powerful way to improve delivery, engagement, and quality. Successfully and repeatable Scaling agile to medium and large organizations has been a problem, though. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) has emerged as the leading solution to that problem. **SAFe is a collection of principles, structures, and practices** that has been shown to consistently and successfully scale Agile practices and deliver the benefits of Agile to organizations that had been working in waterfall or ad-hoc methodologies.

* **Framework for applying Lean and Agile practices at the enterprise scale**

## Lean Thinking

* The Goal **Value**
* The Pillars
  * **Respect for people**
  * **Product Deployment Flow**
  * **Kaizen**
* Foundation : **Leadership**

### Kaizen
Kaizen, is the Japanese word for "improvement". In business, kaizen refers to activities that continuously improve all functions and involve all employees from the CEO to the assembly line workers. It also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics, that cross organizational boundaries into the supply

The cycle of kaizen activity can be defined as: **"Plan → Do → Check → Act"**. This is also known as the Shewhart cycle, Deming cycle, or PDCA.

# Lean Enterprise

## Underlying principles of SAFe
According to its authors, SAFe is based upon nine underlying concepts, which are derived from existing lean and agile principles, as well as observation;

1. Take an economic view
1. Apply systems thinking
1. Assume variability; preserve options
1. Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
1. Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems
1. Visualize and limit work-in-progress, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue lengths
1. Apply cadence (timing), synchronize with cross-domain planning
1. Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
1. Decentralize decision-making

## The SAFe framework
There are four configurations: essential, portfolio, large solution and full:[27]

* Essential SAFe is the most basic configuration. It describes the most critical elements needed and is intended to provide the majority of the framework's benefits. It includes the team and program level (which it calls agile release trains or ARTs).
* Portfolio SAFe includes concerns for strategic direction, investment funding, and lean governance.
* Large Solution SAFe allows for coordination and synchronization across multiple programs, but without the portfolio considerations. In earlier versions of SAFe, this level was referred to as value stream.
* Full SAFe combines the other three levels.

## Release Train

In SAFe terms, the “Release Train” is the team-of-teams, typically 50–125 individuals. Like a real train, the release train runs on a schedule, though that schedule can be as flexible as your organization needs it to be. This Program Increment (PI) is described in more detail below. SAFe suggests that people involved in a release train be dedicated full-time to that release train, regardless of reporting structure.

The release train supports a long-term program that may have many teams and projects inside of it. The teams synchronize, lining up sprints and releases, so the code can be deployed at the same time for each increment. Older versions of SAFe suggested a “hardening sprint” (or two), not for testing within teams as much as for coordinating interfaces between teams. It might be best to think of the hardening sprint as a transitional step – something new program teams need to make the release train successful.

# SAFe

It operates at 4 levels

1. Portfolio
1. Large Solutions
1. Program
1. Teams : At this level teams work on both Kanban or Scrum
