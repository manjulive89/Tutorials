# First Class

The following is the first Java Class

	1  public class MyFirstClass {
  	2  	public static void main(String[] args) {
    3  		System.out.println("Hello World");
    4   }
    5  }

The above is a class definition for MyFirstClass
* Line 1 : defines the class name
* Line 2 : defined the method in the class
* Line 3 : prints "Hello World" sting int the console
* Line 4 : indicates the end of the main method
* Line 5 : indicates the end of the class definition 

This must be save in that file with the same name as the classname with java extenstion (MyFirstClass.java).
