# Python

Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python is named after a TV Show called ëMonty Pythonís Flying Circusí and not after Python-the snake.

Python is cross-platform, which means you can run it on all major platforms like Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Python is open source software and, as a result, has a large community of developers who help improve and contribute to the language.

Currently, the main implementation of Python, CPython, is managed by the Python Software Foundation, a non-profit organization working to develop and maintain the Python standards.

Python 3.0 was released in 2008. This version is supposed to be backward **incompatibles**.


## 1 - Introduction to Python

The following is an example of some of the capabilities offered by python 3

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

print ('#' * 80)     # Prints "#" 80 times

str = 'Hello World!'

print (str)          # Prints complete string
print (str[0])       # Prints first character of the string
print (str[2:5])     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
print (str[2:])      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
print (str * 2)      # Prints string two times
print (str + "TEST") # Prints concatenated string
