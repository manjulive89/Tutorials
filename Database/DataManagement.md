## Data Management â€“ Fundamentals

* Legacy / flat file formats (e.g., delimited text files), flat tables, use of delimiters and pointers
* Roles:
  * Data Analyst,
  * Database Administrator (DBA),
  * ETL developer,
  * Database Developer,
  * Data Architect,
  * Enterprise Information Architects

* Data types:
  * Structured,
  * Semi-Structured,
  * None-Structured

* Types of databases:
  * Relational (OLTP) ,
  * object-oriented,
  * NoSQL (non-relational),
  * Geospatial,
  * Data Warehouse (OLAP)

* Relational
  * Understanding databases, schemas, tables, views (including materialized)
  * Understanding fields, field-types, primary keys (including compound and composite), foreign keys,
    * unique keys (anonymous/surrogate keys vs. smart/intelligent /natural), random keys (GUIDs) vs auto increment key
      * Understanding table joining, normalization, indexing, and ACID
      * Queries and ANSI SQL, vendor implementations of SQL (PL-SQL, T-SQL), triggers, and stored procedures
      * SQL injection vulnerabilities
      * Major implementations (e.g. Oracle, SQL Server, UDB/DB2)
  * Non-relational
    * Document (including XML) vs Column stores
    * Comparison to relational
    * Major implementations
  * Geospatial Databases
    * Understanding point, lines and polygons
    * Geospatial queries
* Understanding ETL and data integration
* Understanding data modeling
* Operational data stores (ODS)
* Data warehouses, data marts, multi-dimensional cubes and business intelligence (snowflake vs star schemas)
* Data lakes
* Storage architectures (distributed, P2P, clustered and mirrored)
* Cloud-based data management technologies (object storage like S3)
* Big-data data architectures
