## Linux History
* Unix
* Debian GNU (Free Software Fundation FSF)
* Linux
## Operating System
Gerally operating system mamanges the system resources.

There are three major parts;
1- File system
2- Users
3- Process
4- Network
5- Other system resources
  * Hardware devices
  * Memory
  * CPU

## Linux Boot Process

The following is the boot order in Linux;

1. BIOS
2. Boot Loader
   - LILO
   - GRUB
1. initd
2. /boot
3. vmlinux or vmlinuz

* `Basic Input Output System (BIOS)`, is firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer's system board (Mother board), and it is always the first software to run when any computer is powered on, regardless of the operating system. BIOS perfroms diagnostic tests on some of the componenets on the computer, and then loads the `Boot Loader`.

* The primary use of boot loader as the name stands is to load and start the execution of the `operating system`. There are two basic `boot loaders on Linux`

  * `LILO or Linux Loader`: originally was the default boot loader for most Linux distributions.  Further development of LILO was discontinued in December 2015.

  * `GRUB or GNU GRand Unified Bootloader`: it provides a user the choice to boot one of multiple operating systems installed on a computer or select a specific kernel configuration available on a particular operating system's partitions.

* `initrd or Initial ramdisk` : is a scheme for loading a temporary root file system into memory, which may be used as part of the Linux startup process. `initrd` and `initramfs` refer to two different methods of achieving this. Both are commonly used to make preparations before the real root file system can be mounted. the `initrd` contains helpers to detect hardware detection. This init

 * `vmlinux or vmlinuz` is the kernel / the operating system. the `vmlinuz` is a compressed version of the operating system.
