# API Gateway

 * An API Gateway is a reverse proxy, optimised for authentication and access control against API endpoints.

 * Acts as the single entryway into a system allowing multiple APIs or microservices to act cohesively and provide a uniform experience to the user. The most important role the API gateway plays is ensuring reliable processing of every API call. In addition, the API gateway provides the ability to design API specs, help provide enterprise-grade security, and manage APIs centrally.
