# Customer Obsession:

## Tell me about a time that you had to handle a dificualt customer

* Situation 1: (Needs Work) I was with customer that had issues with system stablity, I was with Oracle Corp.
  - I was on there to help the customer to setup the service registry and serive repostiroy, however they asked to help them with issues with weblogic.
  - I asked to check the logs on the weblogic, I saw the errorlogs trace is going faster than the screen can scrol.
  - The progrmmers used exceptions as a mean to control the application flow, and they use the stack trace for logs.
  - Also exceptions can have an impact on the performance of the application
  - I had to convince them while weblogic is execive time spent on writting logs messages to the log thread.


* Situation 2: I was working on ObamaCare for the State of Oregan, with very tight deadline. This was a B2B application with ESB, and database.
    - The team developed, tested the application and moved we moved it to production,
    - Eventually the team was desolved and everyone went home. I had to stay in for the waranty.
    - At this time I was informed that I need to move the entire application stack to a new set of hardware since we developed the application on a borrowed infrustructure.
    - Took lots of sleepleess night but sniff test and regression test was successful
    - My main concern was to make sure that application is fully functional and adhears to the requirments
    - what customer wants is what customer gets.

## How do you Wow customers

* Situation 1:
  - I responsible and the scope of my work to setup a oracle B2B portal to allow customer to recive EDI and process them with high availablity. I was the only person from Oracle.
  - I setup the portal, wrote a proof of concept to show them it works andd also to helpthem use that as part of actual application.
  - While I was there I also help them reosove some of their issue with Weblogic, that was totally outside of my SOW.

* situation 2:
  - Was called on a customer for a performance issue on the service SLA's.
  - I was working of services and ddefining the response time on services. I found one of the utility services with a very poor response time.
  - After checking the IP on the service I foundout that the service in the production is still configured to a developers machine.

* Situation 3 : was sent to GM to identify a major performance issue.
  - HP Cloud, HP did not allow diagnotics on the system and network layer.
  - The system was over commited.
  - System performace was as expected after business hours.

## How do you develope client relationships

I generally promisse the moon and deliver the sun, I am honest, and open to share the information

* Situation 1: Customer created a cluster at the operating system level,
  - I showed them that they can have a clustering at Weblogic level, this enhanced their system avialablity.
  - 2 with min 3 node cluster with a node manager. each node shared the session infromation with its own secondary node.

* Situation 2: I was in to help customer to fix a major with system aviability and stability,
  - helped them to setup development process, that included utit testing and regrasion testing.
  - Helped them to setup teams

## How do you understand your customers needs

* Situation one: Go to customer for application server optimization and found that database needs to be optimized
- while in Oracle I used to go and talk to stakeholders and identify what they need, regardless of SOW I used to get,
- I had to deliver both SOW (Legally) and meet the customer needs
  - what are the needs, constraints, and expectations are.
  - I had a reource for Database and I did JVM and Weblogic optiomization

## Tell me about the time you could not meet your commitments

* Situation 1: I was just hired for a project in IBM
  - The customer was not happy with the response time of the system, the development wrote a stored procedure with over 3500 line of code, that was the heart of the application many issues including row-locking and many other issues. The rewrite was taking lot longer than the deadline due to the fact that code needed to be changes and all needed to be fully tested.
  - Step 1 to optimize it to be able to partially meet the customer expectation.
  - Step 2 commit to client to rewite it by next release as we did

# Ownership

## Tell me about a time behind your responsiblity

* Situation one : Fredie Mac
  - Develp a three tiered application. Theway customer used to develop was to develop application in a jar and all the needed jar in the classpath. This is not a greates approach creates a versioning nightmare.
  - I started to create selfcontained jar files using maven that one wars or jars was self contained. and shared that with all other development teams to start as a practice
## Tell me about a time you took something significant outside my responsibility

## Give an example when you saw a peer struggling and you steped in to help
* Situation one: NCIS
* Situation two: Configuring Server for system admin in CACI
