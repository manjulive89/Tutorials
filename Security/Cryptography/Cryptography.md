Cryptographic algorithms and protocols can be grouped into four main areas:

* Symmetric encryption: Used to conceal the contents of blocks or streams of data of any size, including messages, files, encryption keys, and passwords.
* Asymmetric encryption: Used to conceal small blocks of data, such as encryption keys and hash function values, which are used in digital signatures.
* Data integrity algorithms: Used to protect blocks of data, such as messages, from alteration.
* Authentication protocols: These are schemes based on the use of cryptographic algorithms designed to authenticate the identity of entities.

```
Computer Security: The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications).

`Confidentiality`: This term covers two related concepts:
* `Data confidentiality`: Assures that private or confidential information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
* `Privacy`: Assures that individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed.

`Integrity`: This term covers two related concepts:
* `Data integrity`: Assures that information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner.
* `System integrity`: Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system.

`Availability`: Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users.
