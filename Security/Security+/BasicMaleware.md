#### Types of ransomware

`Crypto malware` This form of ransomware can cause a lot of damage because it encrypts things like your files, folders, and hard-drives. One of the most familiar examples is the destructive 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack. It targeted thousands of computer systems around the world that were running Windows OS and spread itself within corporate networks globally. Victims were asked to pay ransom in Bitcoin to retrieve their data.

`Lockers` Locker-ransomware is known for infecting your operating system to completely lock you out of your computer or devices, making it impossible to access any of your files or applications. This type of ransomware is most often Android-based.

`Scareware` Scareware is fake software that acts like an antivirus or a cleaning tool. Scareware often claims to have found issues on your computer, demanding money to resolve the problems. Some types of scareware lock your computer. Others flood your screen with annoying alerts and pop-up messages.

`Doxware` Commonly referred to as leakware or extortionware, doxware threatens to publish your stolen information online if you don’t pay the ransom. As more people store sensitive files and personal photos on their computers, it’s understandable that some people panic and pay the ransom when their files have been hijacked.

`RaaS` Otherwise known as “Ransomware as a service,” RaaS is a type of malware hosted anonymously by a hacker. These cybercriminals handle everything from distributing the ransomware and collecting payments to managing decryptors — software that restores data access — in exchange for their cut of the ransom.

`Mac ransomware` Mac operating systems were infiltrated by their first ransomware in 2016. Known as KeRanger, this malicious software infected Apple user systems through an app called Transmission, which was able to encrypt its victims’ files after being launched.
Ransomware on mobile devices. Ransomware began infiltrating mobile devices on a larger scale in 2014. What happens? Mobile ransomware often is delivered via a malicious app, which leaves a message on your device that says it has been locked due to illegal activity.

#### The origins of ransomware

How did ransomware get started? While initially targeting individuals, later ransomware attacks have been tailored toward larger groups like businesses with the intent of yielding bigger payouts. Here are some notable dates on the ransomware timeline that show how it got its start, how it progressed, and where ransomware is now.

`PC Cyborg` also known as the AIDS Trojan, in the late 1980s. This was the first ransomware, released by AIDS researcher Joseph Popp. Popp carried out his attack by distributing 20,000 floppy disks to other AIDS researchers. Little did the researchers know, these disks contained malware that would encrypt their C: directory files after 90 reboots and demand payment.

`GpCode in 2004` This threat implemented a weak form of RSA encryption on victims’ personal files until they paid the ransom.

`WinLock in 2007` Rather than encrypting files, this form of ransomware locked its victims out of their desktops and then displayed pornographic images on their screens. In order to remove the images, victims had to pay a ransom with a paid SMS.

`Reveton in 2012` This so-called law enforcement ransomware locked its victims out of their desktops while showing what appeared to be a page from an enforcement agency such as the FBI. This fake page accused victims of committing crimes and told them to pay a fine with a prepaid card.
CryptoLocker in 2013. Ransomware tactics continued to progress, especially by 2013 with this military-grade encryption that used key storage on a remote server. These attacks infiltrated over 250,000 systems and reaped $3 million before being taken offline.

`Locky in 2016` So-called Locky ransomware used social engineering to deliver itself via email. When it was first released, potential victims were enticed to click on an attached Microsoft Word document, thinking the attachment was an invoice that needed to be paid. But the attachment contained malicious macros. More recent Locky ransomware has evolved into the use of JavaScript files, which are smaller files that can more easily evade anti-malware products.

`WannaCry in 2017` These more recent attacks are examples of encrypting ransomware, which was able to spread anonymously between computers and disrupt businesses worldwide.
Sodinokibi in 2019. The cybercriminals who created this ransomware used managed service providers (MSPs) like dental offices to infiltrate victims on a larger scale.
