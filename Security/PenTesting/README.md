# Pen Testing
Penetration testing is security testing in which assessors mimic real-world attacks to identify methods for circumventing the security features of an application, system, or network. It often involves launching real attacks on real systems and data that use tools and techniques commonly used by attackers.

## Types of Pennetration Testing

Generally speaking, there are two main types of penetration tests:

* `External`: These tests are performed from the outside of the testing area (usually network) and mimicking potential external threats. The External penetration tests could be additionally divided into several types by different criteria, sometimes based on targets:

  - VPN penetration tests
  - Web application penetration tests
  - Wi-Fi penetration tests

* `Internal`: These tests are performed from the inside of network and imitate a potential internal intruder, who could be a visitor (authorized or not) able to connect to the office network or a disloyal employee.

##  Penetration testing classification
Penetration tests are most-widely classified as follows:

* `Black box`: Penetration tester does not have any information about his targets prior to testing
* `Gray box`: Penetration tester has some basic information about target infrastructure
* `White box`: Penetration tester has all the information he needs and is able to ask the customer for additional info during the testing process

## Essential skills

The followings are some of the skill sets:

* Discovery techniques
* Enumeration techniques
* Scanning techniques
* Network vulnerability exploitation
* Privilege escalation
* OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities discovery and exploitation
* Password and hash attacks
* Wireless attacks
* Modifying and testing exploits
* Tunneling
* Fuzzing
* Vulnerability research
* Documenting the penetration testing process

As with most methodologies, the step is broken down into two types,

* `Active` : part of the reconnaissance as being intrusive and involves attempting zone transfers and other types of activity that will be detected and/or blocked by the `Intrusion Detection System (IDS)` and `Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)`

* `Passive` : refers to the nonintrusive approach of testing. The framework lists a number of sites to assist with gathering the information.

# Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)
provides technical procedures that can be used in a penetration test. The standard consists of seven main sections, and
these are as follows:

* Pre-engagement interactions
* Intelligence gathering
* Threat modeling
* Vulnerability analysis
* Exploitation
* Post-exploitation
* Reporting
