As with most methodologies, the step is broken down into two types,

* `Active` : part of the reconnaissance as being intrusive and involves attempting zone transfers and other types of activity that will be detected and/or blocked by the `Intrusion Detection System (IDS)` and `Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)`

* `Passive` : refers to the nonintrusive approach of testing. The framework lists a number of sites to assist with gathering the information.

# Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)
provides technical procedures that can be used in a penetration test. The standard consists of seven main sections, and
these are as follows:

* Pre-engagement interactions
* Intelligence gathering
* Threat modeling
* Vulnerability analysis
* Exploitation
* Post-exploitation
* Reporting
