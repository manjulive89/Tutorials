## Cloud HSM

AWS CloudHSM provides hardware security modules in the AWS Cloud. A hardware security module
(HSM) is a computing device that processes cryptographic operations and provides secure storage for
cryptographic keys.

When you use an HSM from AWS CloudHSM, you can perform a variety of cryptographic tasks:

* Generate, store, import, export, and manage cryptographic keys, including symmetric keys and asymmetric key pairs.
* Use symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data.
* Use cryptographic hash functions to compute message digests and hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs).
* Cryptographically sign data (including code signing) and verify signatures.
* Generate cryptographically secure random data.
