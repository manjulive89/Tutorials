# What is Salesforce

Salesforce started as a cloud based solution for Customer Relationship Management (CRM). It involves managing all aspects of relationship between an organization and its customers. For example, the contact details of the customer, the deals that are in progress or already completed, the support requests from a customer or a new lead from a new customer.

Beyond the customer related information, it also involves storing and managing the details of the people and the concerned department from the seller organization that is managing the customer’s account and needs. This makes it easy to manage and enhance the relationship with the customer and hence better growth for the organization.

Salesforce is your customer success platform, designed to help you sell, service, market, analyze, and connect with your customers. Run your business from anywhere with Salesforce. Use standard products and features to manage relationships with prospects and customers, collaborate and engage with employees and partners,
and store your data securely in the cloud.But standard products and features are only the beginning. With our platform, you can customize and personalize the experience for your customers, partners, and employees and easily extend
beyond out of the box functionality.

# What is CRM

CRM, or customer relationship management, helps you manage your customer relationships and keep customers happy. While most think of it as sales software designed to help you grow your customer base, it can also be so much more. When you layer in the different ways CRM can be implemented across the business, and that a 'customer' could be an employee or partner, it gets a little more complex.

We've created a series of articles that breakdown what CRM is, why it is important to business and how it can be used. Our goal is to help you assess your need for CRM and make actionable decisions for your business.

A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system helps manage customer data. It supports sales management, delivers actionable insights, integrates with social media and facilitates team communication. Cloud-based CRM systems offer complete mobility and access to an ecosystem of bespoke apps.

* [CRM](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/learning-centre/crm/)

Sales is the life blood of every business. But with targets to hit, competitors trying to steal that deal, and colleagues vying to become the company's top performer, staying ahead of the curve isn't easy. You need to be constantly looking for ways to learn new skills or gain new insights that you can bring to the business. We've created content to help you do just that—stay on top by developing your career, your organisation, and your team.


Following are some of the features of the Salesforce platform −

### Sales Management

Sales management is the process of hiring, training and motivating sales staff, coordinating operations across the sales department and implementing a cohesive sales strategy that drives business revenues. Sales are the lifeblood of any organisation and managing the sales process is one of the most important functions of any business.


In recent years, that process has changed dramatically as the vast majority of sales take place online or over the phone instead of in person. And in response, sales management systems have become more technologically sophisticated.

* [Sales Management](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/learning-centre/sales/sales-management/)


### Contact Management

To view customer contact details, activity history, customer communications, and internal account discussions, etc. In short, it manages all the data pertaining to the contact with a customer.

Contact management is the process of recording contacts’ details and tracking their interactions with a business. Such systems have gradually evolved into an aspect of customer relationship management (CRM) systems, which allow businesses to improve sales and service levels leveraging a wider range of data.

* [Contact Management](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/learning-centre/sales/contact-management/)
*
### Opportunity Management

It provides the details of the stage a deal is in, the products involved in the deal, the quotation for the deal etc. In short it manages all the data that helps in identifying, progressing and closing a deal.

### Salesforce Engage

This feature is focused on making personalized contact with a customer for various campaigns designed by the marketing team. It also provides real-time sales alerts based on the level of engagement with a customer.

### Sales Collaboration

This feature helps in quickly finding experts who can help in closing a deal based on customer queries and feedback. In short, it helps in bringing in a collaborative effort to engage an entire team in the deal and make the deal happen.

### Sales Performance Management

It provides a metric-based goal setting, and also continuous feedback and rewards and recognition for the sales team. This helps in enhancing the performance of the sales team.

### Lead Management

This feature initiates and tracks the leads that are in progress. It also helps in continually optimizing campaigns across every channel.

### Partner Management

This feature helps in building a community with partners. It also helps in connecting directly with channel partners to share goals, objectives, and activities.

### Salesforce Mobile App

This is the mobile platform to carry out all the above activities on a mobile platform.

### Workflow and Approvals

It is a visual design to automate the business processes. The interface provides simple drag and drop options to make this design. It helps in creating a flexible approval process with deal discounts and expense management etc.

### Email Integration

Salesforce can integrate to an existing email platform. This helps in providing flexibility to the existing team with no additional learning curve.

### Files Sync and Share

This feature provides the sales team the power to easily share various files, discuss them and update them as needed. Also receive alerts when something in the file changes.

### Reports and Dashboards

Dashboards offer a real-time picture of the business at a glance. With this, anyone can create detailed reports which can be accessed from anywhere.

### Sales Forecasting

This feature helps in getting a real time view of the forecast of a sales team. It provides multi-currency support and an in-line editing mode to manage the sales forecast well.

### Territory Management

This feature is used to create multiple territory models, preview them before rollout, and continually optimize and balance territories throughout the year.

## Salesforce Admin

The Salesforce administrator—or “admin” is a Salesforce user with system administration duties and other super powers. Admins are responsible for setting up Salesforce for their organizations and making sure it runs smoothly.

Admins have special permissions. For example, they can add user accounts and specify what people can see and do in Salesforce. Admins can create custom Salesforce objects, workflows, validation rules, reports, and more. Admins can manage user profile information and delete Chatter feed updates, including posts and comments. Admins are planners, problem-solvers, and heroes. All Salesforce organizations have at least one administrator. Your administrator’s role can be as simple or as complex as your company’s size and structure. In smaller
organizations, the admin is often someone who also uses Salesforce the way other users do: to sell products or provide customer service,
for example.

Salesforce offers lots of features and items that you can set up and configure yourself. For some things, though, partner with your trusty admin to help you get the best of what Salesforce has to offer. Here are a few examples of the kinds of things your admin can help you with or do for you.

* Find or use an object, field, or feature you heard about during training.
* Create a custom workflow that lets you find out when a case is closed.
* Create a custom approval process that allows you to sign off on employee expenses.
* Create a custom report for your sales region.
* Give you a user permission that’s not granted as part of your user profile.
* Answer questions about your own or others’ access to records.
* Address those cursed error messages that ask you to contact your administrator
for help or more information.

## What is Force.com?

Force.com is a natural progression from Salesforce.com, which was started as a
sales force automation system offered as a service (SaaS). The need to go beyond the initially offered customizable CRM application and develop custom-based solutions, resulted in a radical shift of cloud delivery model from SaaS to PaaS. The technology that powers Salesforce CRM, whose design fulfills all the prerequisites of being a cloud application, is now available for developing enterprise-level applications.

An independent study of the Force.com platform concluded that compared
to the traditional Java-based application development platform, development
with the Force.com platform is almost five times faster, with about a 40 percent
smaller overall project cost and better quality due to rapid prototyping during
the requirement gathering—thanks to the declarative aspect of the Force.com
development—and less testing due to proven code re-use.

# Salesforce CRM terminology

Here are the basic Salesforce CRM terms you’ll need to know:
* **Leads** – A lead is anyone who may be interested in your products or services; for example, someone you met at a conference or who filled out a Web form.
* **Opportunities** – An opportunity is a possible deal you want to track. By adding an opportunity, you build a “pipeline” you can use for forecasting.
* **Accounts** – An account is an organization, individual, or company that you want to track. An account can include customers, competitors, and/or partners and stores information such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers.
* **Contacts** – Contacts are the individuals associated with the accounts you’re tracking. For each contact, you can store information such as phone numbers, titles, and roles in a deal.

## Architecture Salesforce
The architecture of Salesforce can be put into layers for better understanding. The purpose and function of each layer is described below −

### Trusted Multitenant Cloud
Here multiple instances of one or multiple applications operate independently in a shared environment. The instances are referred as tenants and they logically separate from each other while physically remaining in the same hardware. It is called trusted because of both its robust nature and high security.

### Multitenancy
Multitenancy is a concept that is the opposite of single-tenancy. In the Cloud
Computing jargon, a customer or an organization is referred to as tenant. The
various downsides and cost inefficiencies of single-tenant models are overcame by
the multitenant model. A multitenant application caters to multiple organizations, each working in its own isolated virtual environment called org and sharing a single physical instance and version of the application hosted on the Force.com infrastructure. It is isolated because although the infrastructure is shared, every customer's data, customizations, and code remain secure and insulated from other customers.

Multitenant applications run on a single physical instance and version of the
application, providing the same robust infrastructure to all their customers. This also means freedom from upfront costs, ongoing upgrades, and maintenance costs. The test methods written by the customers on respective orgs ensure more than 75 percent code coverage and thus help Salesforce.com in regression testing of the Force.com upgrades, releases, and patches. The same is difficult to even visualize with an in-house software application development.

### Scalable Metadata Platform
The metadata driven platform makes it easy for customization and scaling up as the amount of data or concurrent user instances increase.

What drives the multitenant applications on Force.com? Nothing else but the
metadata-driven architecture of the platform! Think about the following:

* The platform allows all tenants to coexist at the same time
* Tenants can extend the standard common object model without
affecting others
* Tenants' data is kept isolated from others in a shared database
* The platform customizes the interface and business logic without disrupting
the services for others
* The platform's codebase can be upgraded to offer new features without
affecting the tenants' customizations
* The platform scales up with rising demands and new customers

To meet all the listed challenges, Force.com has been built upon a metadata-driven architecture, where the runtime engine generates application components from the metadata. All customizations to the standard platform for each tenant are stored in the form of metadata, thus keeping the core Force.com application and the client customizations distinctly separate, making it possible to upgrade the core without affecting the metadata. The core Force.com application comprises the application data and the metadata describing the base application, thus forming three layers sitting on top of each other in a common database, with the runtime engine interpreting all these and rendering the final output in the client browser.

As metadata is a virtual representation of the application components and
customizations of the standard platform, the statically compiled Force.com
application's runtime engine is highly optimized for dynamic metadata access and
advanced caching techniques to produce remarkable application response times.

### Enterprise Ecosystem
The Enterprise Ecosystem of Sales is very large as a large number of partners contribute by creating and maintaining applications in this platform.

### CRM and Related Functionality
Salesforce includes all aspects of CRM in its list of features and also extends it by providing features for creation of apps and integrating analytics, etc.

### APIs
Salesforce provides powerful suite of APIs. This helps to develop and customize the Salesforce1 Mobile App.

### Governors Limits

Any introduction to Force.com is incomplete without a mention of governor limits. By nature, all multitenant architecture based applications such as Force.com have to have a mechanism that does not allow the code to abuse the shared resources so that other tenants in the infrastructure remain unaffected. In the Force.com world, it is the Apex runtime engine that takes care of such malicious code by enforcing runtime limits (called governor limits) in almost all areas of programming on the Force.com platform.

If these governor limits had not been in place, even the simplest code, such as an endless loop, would consume enough resources to disrupt the service to the other users of the system, as they all share the same physical infrastructure. The concept of governor limits is not just limited to Force.com, but extends to all SaaS/PaaS applications, such as Google App Engine, and is critical for making the cloud-based development platform stable.

This concept may prove to be very painful for some people, but there is a key logic to it. The platform enforces the best practices so that the application is practically usable and makes an optimal usage of resources, keeping the code well under governor limits. So the longer you work on Force.com, the more you become familiar with these limits, the more stable your code becomes over time, and the easier it becomes to work around these limits.

In one of the forthcoming chapters, we will discover how to work with these
governor limits and not against them, and also talk about ways to work around
them, if required.

## Objectives

Sales Cloud part of the Salesforce.com platform which is focused on enhancing the effectiveness of the sales team of an organization and hence increases the amount of sales. It stands unique when compared to other sales methods as it provides both the account information of the customer as well as the information gathered from the social platforms about the product and customer. This helps in judging the potential of a sales lead and closing the sales faster.

Following are the Key business Goals achieved by using the Sales Cloud.

### Close more deals
The availability of all the account information as well as product information for customer’s needs makes it easier to drive more number of leads to closure.

### Close deals faster
Mobile apps and visual design of the workflows for business process approvals makes it faster to close the deals.

### Get more deals
Continuous optimization of campaigns depending on the market response and closure interaction with channel partners gets more deals.

### Quicker decisions
The availability of reports and dashboards gives a very detailed picture of the business scenario and also increases accuracy of sales forecasting. So the business decisions are taken quickly.

## Sandbox Vs. Development Environment

An environment is a set of resources, physical or logical, that let users build,
test, deploy, and use applications. In the traditional development model, one
would expect to have application servers, web servers, databases, and their costly provisioning and configuration. But in the Force.com paradigm, all that's needed is a computer and an Internet connection to immediately get started to build and test a SaaS application.

An environment, or a virtual or logical instance of the Force.com infrastructure and platform, is also called an organization or just org, which is provisioned in the cloud on demand. It has the following characteristics:

* Used for development, testing, and/or production
* Contains data and customizations
* Based on the edition containing specific functionality, objects, storage,
and limits
* Certain restricted functionalities, such as the multicurrency feature (which is
not available by default), can be enabled on demand
* All environments are accessible through a web browser

There are broadly three types of environments available for developing, testing, and deploying applications:

* Production environments: The Salesforce.com environments that have active
paying users accessing the business critical data.
* Development environments: These environments are used strictly for the
development and testing applications with data that is not business critical,
without affecting production environment. Developer environments are of
two types:

	* Developer Edition: This is a free, full-featured copy of the Enterprise Edition, with less storage and users. It allows users to create packaged applications suitable for any Salesforce production environment. It can be of two types:

		* Regular Developer Edition: This is a regular DE org whose sign up is free and the user can register for any number of DE orgs. This is suitable when you want to develop managed packages for distribution through AppExchange or Trialforce, when you are working with an edition where sandbox is not available, or if you just want to explore the Force.com platform for free.

		* Partner Developer Edition: This is a regular DE org but with more storage, features, and licenses. This is suitable when you expect a larger team to work who need a bigger environment to test the application against a larger real-life dataset. Note that this org can only be created with the Salesforce Consulting partners or Force.com ISV.

	* Sandbox: This is nearly an identical copy of the production environment available to Enterprise or Unlimited Edition customers, and can contain data and/or customizations. This is suitable when developing applications for production environments only with no plans to distribute applications commercially through AppExchange or Trialforce, or if you want to test the beta-managed packages. Note that sandboxes are completely isolated from your Salesforce production organization, so operations you perform in your sandboxes do not affect your Salesforce production organization, and vice versa. Types of sandboxes are as follows:

		* Full copy sandbox: Nearly an identical copy of the production environment, including data and customizations

		* Configuration-only sandbox: Contains only configurations and not data from the production environment

		* Developer sandbox: Same as Configuration-only sandbox but with less storage

* Test environments: These can be either production or developer environments, used speficially for testing application functionality before deploying to production or releasing to customers. These environments are suitable when you want to test applications in production such as environments with more users and storage to run real-life tests.

### Production environment
Production environments are those that store live data and are used by customers
to run their business. These environments can be based on various editions such
as Group, Professional, Enterprise, or Unlimited Editions, if Salesforce CRM
functionality is required. If CRM functionality is not needed, customers can sign
up for Force.com Edition. For developing the applications for personal production
use or for selling them commercially to customers with the Salesforce production
environments, development environments are used. Note that Apex code editing is
not allowed in production environments; however, declarative development, such
as creating workflows, approval processes, or creating object validation rules can be directly done here.

### Development environments
These are environments that are strictly used for development and testing purposes, where you can make changes without affecting end users on the production org. These are necessary for enterprise application development, so there may be multiple environments for various purposes such as development, integration, testing, training, and so on.

There are two kinds of development environments: sandbox organizations
and Developer Edition organizations; these are covered in more detail in the
following sections.

### Sandbox orgs
A sandbox is nearly an identical copy of your production environment available to
Enterprise or Unlimited Edition customers. It contains the copy of the metadata of your production org and can include data, configurations, or both. Configurations include custom objects, fields, applications, workflows, and anything else that has been created to describe your organization and business processes.

From a developer's perspective, it is highly unlikely that any development happens directly in the production environment unless there are specific limitations such as unavailability of sandboxes in Professional and Group Editions. Accordingly, Salesforce has also provided corresponding environments that enable developers to follow a traditional development approach where they can collaborate with other developers to create or configure applications without affecting end users.

---

## Setup Options
The Salesforce developer uses the setup area to configure and customize the interface. It is also used to add and support other users, and build various other functionalities. There are many paths to reach the same setup button. In this tutorial, we will see the most commonly used setup paths and configurations.

The Salesforce Home page has both classic and modern Lighting User Interface. We are referring to the modern lighting interface. All most all the features are available in both The classic and Lighting User Interface come with many features that prove beneficial to the users.

### Setup Location
The setup link is located in the top right corner of the main page . Clicking on the setup home takes us to the setup home page.

Below page shows the setup home where we see all the options available for the developer to configure and customize the option.

### Setup Home

The following table lists down the important features which are frequently used in setup activity.

* **Users** Create, Remove Users. Manage User profiles and Permissions.
* **Company Settings** Information related to your org. Like - Language, Maps and Locations, Domain etc.
* **Security** Expire Passwords, Access Policies, Session Management and Setup Audit Trails.
* **Environment** Jobs, Logs and Sandboxes.

## Creating & Manage Users

The administrators can create one or many users using the Admin Interface. Navigate to setup home → Administration → Users. It shows the options for adding one user or many.

It further asks for details of each users like Name, email Address, Role, Profile, etc. On filling those details, the users get created.

1. user can select the default language
2. Time Zone
3. Local
4. Email Encoding

User Password Setting;
1. At least 8 characters
2. At least one special character and one digit in the password

### Password Policies

Password policies refer to the way the passwords are managed in the organization. For example, setting the expiry date of a password, the complexity requirement of a password and so on. All these options are customizable and we can also control the lock of policies. These password policies are set by navigating to setup home → Security → Password Policies.

includes;
1. expiration duration
2. Number of password history to remember
3. Minimum length
4. Password Questions
3. Maximum invalid log in attempts
4. Lockout time delay
5. Obscure answer to questions

### Restricting Access from IP Address

This is an added security which allows only specific range of IP addresses to access the Salesforce platform of the organization. But if a valid user accesses the restricted page outside the trusted IP range then the system asks for additional challenge questions which should have been already configured. This is set by navigating to setup home → Security → Network Access..

#### Certificate Question

While user is working and the User Hours Rang has passed, when a user move to a new page he will be logged out.

			4. Assign profiles associated with the application (Permissions)
Custom Apps are new functionality
Console Apps are extension of the existing CRM apps
-----
## Objects

Objects are collection of Fields and Records,
The Salesforce Platform stores data in relational tables. The records in these tables contain data for the structure of the platform itself as well as user created data. For example, the data about the configuration and settings of an account are already in-built as a relational table. But you can also create your own tables to store data specific to your business like the 'dispatch schedule' for a week assuming you are a courier company.

These relational tables are roughly referred to as API Objects or only objects in Salesforce. There are three kinds of Salesforce objects.

* **Standard Objects** − The objects already created for you by the Salesforce platform.
* **Custom Objects** − These are the objects created by you based on your business processes.
* **External Objects** − The objects which you create map to the data stored outside your organization.

## Standard Objects
These are the objects which already exist in the Salesforce platform to manage the configurations and settings of the environment. Once you log in to the salesforce platform, you can see the available objects.

Example
The most commonly referred standard object is called the Account Object. It is the object which stores the preliminary information about a customer, partner, competitor or another organization. We can explore the account object by following the steps below.

### Step 1


Login to the Salesforce platform and follow the link path Settings → Setup Home → Object Manager - Account.
There are two types of Objects

### Step 2
In this step, click on the Schema Builder. It shows the complete Account table with field names and data types. There are fields marked red. The fields marked red indicate that it is mandatory to fill the fields when an account is created.

Using the similar steps as above we can explore all the standard objects available.

## Important Standard Objects
In this section, we will discuss the important standard objects in Salesforce. The following table lists down the objects −

* **Account**	Represents an individual account, which is an organization or person involved in the business like customers, competitors, partners, etc.	*Use this object to;* query and manage accounts in your organization.
* **Account History**	Represents the history of changes to the values in the fields of an account. *Use this object to;* identify changes to an account.
* **Case**	Represents a case, which is a customer issue or problem.	Use the case object to manage cases for your organization.
* **Contact**	Represents a contact, which is an individual associated with an account.	This object is used to manage individuals who are associated with an Account in the organization.
* **User**	Represents a user in the organization.	This object is used to query information about users and also helps to provide and modify the information concerning the users.
* **Asset**	Represents an item of commercial value, such as a product sold by the company or a competitor that a customer has purchased and installed.	This object is used to track assets previously sold into customer accounts. With asset tracking, a client application can quickly determine which products were previously sold or are currently installed at a specific account.
* **Domain**	Read-only object that represents a custom Web address assigned to a site in your organization.	This read-only object is used to object to query the domains that are associated with each website in your organization.


1. **Standard Objects;** they are build in objects that are provided by SalesForce Platform, they also can be customized by adding fields, you can also override the standard Objects. You can also over-ride the standard objects by the new customized standard object.

2. **Custom Objects;**; new objects created, the are limitations based on the type of License.

### Custom Objects

The organization’s data will always not fit into the existing standard objects. So we can extend and customize the SalesForce objects to meet this need. For example, a courier company can create a custom object to store the schedule and dispatch details for every week. So these objects store the data that is unique to the business.The custom objects can also have custom fields along with the standard fields available in Salesforce.

In other cases Custom Objects can be created to provide addtional information that is not supported by the Standard Objects.

## Custom Object features
Following are the features available on Custom Objects. The features help you perform the following features −

* Build page layouts to control which fields users can view and edit when entering data for the custom object record.
* Import custom object records.
* Create reports and dashboards to analyze custom object data.
* Create a custom tab for the custom object, to display the object’s data.
* Track tasks and events for custom object records.
* Import custom object records.

## Create a Custom Object
To create a custom object, we go to the line path as shown in the following screenshot −
To create Objects,

1. Create-> Object, select Create new Custom Object or use Schema Builder,
	1. Provide appropriate information, including name, type, description,
	2. Record Name and Format
	2. Optional Feature

### Create a Custom Field
To Add more granularity to the business data, we can add custom fields on the custom object we created. In this case, let us add a field called delivery date to the custom object named Delivery schedule. To do this, we follow the path Setup Home → Objects and Fields → Object Manager → Deliver Schedule. Later, scroll down to the Fields and Relationship tab and click New. The page to add custom field appears wherein, we fill the details as shown below.


To create fields;
1. Setup

Each field has the following Attributes;

* label
* Length
* Field Name
* Description
* Help Text
* Required
* Unique
* External ID
* Default Value

**Some of the attributes may change based on the data type selected**


### Data Types
#### Basic non-relational field types
Most of the Salesforce field types can be found in many relational databases. Here's a brief summary of the supported data types:
* **Auto Number**: System-generated read-only sequence number, which is useful for generating unique IDs, other than the internal object IDs, which are non writeable fields.
* **Checkbox**: Boolean data.
* **Email, Phone, and URL**: Format-validated e-mail, phone, and URL string representations.
* **Data or Date Time**: Represent dates or date and time combinations.
* **Number**: Represent real numbers, with optional decimal points.
* **Currency**: A formatted number type, with optional multi-currency support.
* **Picklist or Multi Select Picklist**: Represent values from a list.
* **Text or Text Area**: Represent text of various lengths.
* **Text (Encrypted)**: This field allows users to enter any combination of letters, numbers, or symbols (up to 175 characters) that are stored in encrypted form, encrypted with 128-bit master keys using the AES (Advanced Encryption
Standard) algorithm. Using this field you can enable master encryption key
management and contact Salesforce.com.
* **Geolocation**: This is currently in beta release and has some known
limitations (Winter 13). This field allows users to specify a location by its
latitude and longitude.
* **Formula**: A read-only field holding data generated from a formula expression.

### Relational field types
Unlike the relational database, which use keys for maintaining relationships, Force.com utilizes the relationship fields, which hold the ID of the parent record. There are three types of relationship fields in Force.com:
* **Hierarchical Relationship**: This relationship creates a hierarchical lookup
relationship between users. This also allows users to use a lookup field to
associate one user with another that does not directly or indirectly refer to
itself. For example, you can create a custom hierarchical relationship field to
store each user's direct manager.
* **Lookup Relationship**: This creates a relationship that links one object
to another object. This relationship field allows navigating from records
in one object to the related records in another object (both visually and
programmatically).
* **Master-Detail Relationship**: This provides tighter binding than the lookup
relationship. It creates a special type of relationship between two objects—the
child (detail) and the parent (master). For every detail record in a masterdetail
relationship, Force.com requires a relationship field value, and once
the record is created, restricts any further update to it by default. However,
administrators can allow reparenting of records to different parent records.
A master record deletion triggers cascading delete action for all dependent
detail records; for example, deletion of forums should mean removal of
forum posts as well.

The master object in a master-detail relationship can also contain the Rollup
summary fields. These fields contain values calculated from the aggregate
functions performed over the child records in a relationship; for example,
count of child records, sum of values in a field of child records, maximum/
minimum value of a field in a set of filtered child records, and so on.

Although Salesforce does not natively support the concept of many-to-many
relationships between two objects, there is a nice little work around for
creating a custom object, called the junction object, containing two
master-detail relationships. This is covered in more detail in the
Consideration for relationships section.

### Identity fields
Data in this field is completely managed by the Force.com database. It is either
stored in a 15-digit case sensitive form or an 18-digit case insensitive form. Every record has such an identifier and it provides a convenient shortcut to retrieve and display the record. You must have observed Salesforce forming URLs such as https://na3.salesforce.com/00190000006J48S.

Notice here that 00190000006J48S is the record identifier, and when it is used in the preceding format, retrieves the record data and the associated metadata and uses it to render an appropriate user interface on the browser.

### System fields
These are system-managed read-only fields present in all objects, some of which under special circumstances can be updated programmatically. The ID field is one
of them and the rest are as follows:
* **CreatedDate**: The date and time when the object was created
* **CreatedById**: The ID of the user who created the object
* **LastModifiedById**: The ID of the user who last modified the object
* **LastModifiedDate**: The date and time when the object was last modified by
a user
* **SystemModStamp**: The date and time when the object was last modified by a
user or process, such as a trigger

### The Name field
This is a required field that acts like a human-readable record identifier. Even though it is mandated to be unique, but that's what it is intended for. This field is mandatory on the native page layouts and forms the link for navigating to a record's detail page. It can be of two types: a text string or an auto number field, in which case we have to specify the format of the field and the starting number. With each new record, the auto number field increments by one and is non-writable.


The following are the data types available for each field;

* Auto Number
* Formula
* Rollup Summary
* Lookup Relationship
* Master-Detail Relationship
* External Lookup Relationship
* Checkbox
* Currency
* Date
* Date/Time
* Email
* geolocation
* Number
* Percent
* Phone
* Picklist
* Picklist Multiple
* Text
* Text Area
* Text Area (long)
* Text Area (Rich Format)
* Text (Encrypted)
* URL

#### Master-Detail Relationships

Unlike the relationships in relational database, the relationships in Salesforce are not through Primary and Foreign Keys. The relationships are maintained by using the Relationship Fields. It is a custom field which links one object record to another. Through the creation of relationships, we can display the data of all the related records in the record's details page.

The Master Detail relationship is used when we want to control the display of detail records based on the value in the master record. For example, in the courier company model a delivery schedule is always linked to a delivery location. If we remove a delivery location from our list, then all the related delivery schedules should also be eliminated. Such a dependency can be achieved through Master-detail relationship between the sales force objects.

##### Features of Master-Detail Relationship
In this section, we will discuss the features of Master-detail Relationship. The features are listed below −

* Deleting a Master Record, deletes all the detail records.
* A detail record cannot be created without a Master record.
* The permission on the detail record cannot be set. It inherits the permission from the master record.
* The detail record also inherits the sharing rule from master records.
* Both the master and detail records are automatically included in the report record types.

##### Creating Master-detail Relationship
In the courier company example, we will consider the relationship between delivery location and delivery schedule. There is a many-to-one relationship between the delivery schedule records and the delivery location record.

Following are the steps followed to create this relationship −

###### Choose the Relationship Type
In setup home, find the object named Delivery Schedule. In it under the Custom Fields and Relationships related list, click New. Choose the Master-detail Relationship.

####### Choose the Related Object
In the next step, select the object with which this relationship will be created. We choose DeliveryLocation.

####### Name the Relationship and Field
In this step, enter the Relationship Name as well as the name of the Field.

####### Add field to page layout
In the Next step we accept the defaults and move on to add the reference field to the page layout.

####### Add Custom Related Lists
Next, we specify the title for the related list that is associated layout with the parent.

This completes the creation of Master-Detail relationship between DeliveryLocation and Deliveryschedule.

#### Role-up Summary

Role-up Summary is only enabled in Master-Detail Relationship

It works with Master Detail, it summarizes the specific child object Values e.g. Count, Sum, Min, Max, etc.
This field is only enabled when there is a Master-Detail relationship, it is only enables in the Master Objects.
to Create this;
1. Select Role-up Summary in the Master Object as a field type,
2. Provide relevant information
3. Provide the Summary Object (Select the child Object)
	1. Select the following;
		1. Count
		2. Sum
		3. Min (select the field in the child object)
		4. Max (select the field in the child object)
5. Select the filter Criteria

### Field Dependency

- Drop-down list filter
- there is a Controlling field and a dependent Field e.g. Country and state (you select a country and based on that certain states can be selected)
- Easy to summarize picklist values
To create this
* Select the Custom Fields and Relationship
	* new field dependency
	* Select controlling field
	* Select the dependent field
	* Select the values and select include values and save

### Lookups Fields

in Search layout section you can add additional attributes to better search and identify the fields dependencies
This field can perform calculation for Number, Data, Data-time Percentage and Text fields.

Select from Search layout panel
Select edit and select he fields you want

### validation Rules

to ensure data integrity or to make the field mandatory(among others)

* Select new on the Validation Rule when you create new field or Edit an existing field.
* Make the validation active
* Add rule name, active, and description
* Add the functions, and check syntax
* Add Error message
* Select where error should be displayed (provide field name)

### Database features
The Force.com database goes beyond the conventional relation DBs and provides
additional features that speed up application development drastically. Let's talk
about them briefly:
* **Formulas**: This field reflects calculations based on other fields and operations on those fields. For example:

	IF(
		AND(Payment_Due_Date__c < TODAY(),
		ISPICKVAL(Payment_Status__c, "UNPAID")),
		"PAYMENT OVERDUE",
	null )

This formula determines if the payment due date is past and the payment
status is UNPAID. If so, it returns the text PAYMENT OVERDUE and if not, it
leaves the field blank. This example uses a custom date field called Payment
Due Date, a text custom field called Payment Status on contracts, and a
number of formula operators and functions, including IF, AND, ISPICKVAL,
and TODAY.
* **Validation rules**: This field helps prevent users from saving incorrect data
and display appropriate error message to the user. These rules utilize the
same formula syntax to define a formula that is evaluated every time a record
is saved. If the formula evaluates to False, the save operation is aborted and
an error message is displayed.
* **Labels and help**: Every object and record has a label and can include a
description (for internal documentation) and help, which gets automatically
included in the natively generated user interface.
* **Triggers**: Similar to those in a relational DB, triggers in the platform-specific languages, such as Apex, can be invoked before/after insert, update, delete,or undelete.
* **Notes and attachments**: Users can view, add, or edit notes and upload
attachments for individual records. This functionality can be turned on/off
for any object.
* **Field History Tracking**: User can turn on history tracking on certain fields so that when any change is made a new entry gets created in the History related
list, which tracks the old value, new value, date, time, nature of change, and
who made the change.
* **Security**: The database service layer offers various security features for
data protection:
	* Administrative security: Used to allow or disallow a particular set of users certain areas of the Force.com platform functionality.
	* Object-level security: Define CRUD permissions for users.
	* Field-level security: Controls the field visibility and editing ability for users.
	* Record security: Controls the individual record level security through sharing. Record owners have full control over that record and can share it with others if it is set to private.
	* Permission sets: Collection of settings and permissions that extend users' functional access without changing their profiles.

### Page Layouts

**Need more info on how to assign the layout here**

This is about the customization of the User Interface part. The Page layout is mainly involved in the following tasks;

* Sort fields
* Make fields mandatory or Read Only
* Remove a field (Hide a field)
* Sort the related Lists
* Remove a related Lists (Hide a List)

In the edit field section you can find the page layout. this is derived from the page layout that was originally selected during the custom tab creation.
1. Select Edit or Select New provide a layout name
	1. select the existing page layout
	2. you can add / remove button
	3. you can drag and drop or remove fields, lists, by drag-n-drop or right click and remove
	4. you can add or remove sections (and cursor movement across the fields and sections)
	5. you can make the fields read-only or mandatory (right click and select)
	6. Save the final result
	7. Assign the page-layout
		1. Select the profile

you can define the tab movement as well
you can create buttons etc.

### Formula Fields

Perform calculations based on the referenced fields
Select the field select as formula as data type select the fields, add the formula

* It perform automatic calculations and it is auto generated
* you select the return type
* you either use the formal or use drop down to create the formula.

### schema builder
The various objects and their relationships of a Salesforce application can be easily viewed using the Schema builder. And just not viewing, but we can also design, modify and implement new data models using schema builder.

Schema builder has a drag and drop interface which is used to perform all the activities. It shows all the relevant details like - field values, data types, relationship with directions etc.

#### Accessing Schema Builder
From Setup Home, navigate to Objects and Fields → Object Manager → Schema Builder.

#### Viewing Objects
We can see the various objects by selecting them form the left pane. The Element tab represents fields and relationships while the Objects tab represents the standard as well as custom objects.

We have selected three objects named - Account, Delivery Schedule and Delivery Location as shown in the following screenshot.

#### Changing Objects
We can work on various schema objects by showing them in the canvas in the right pane. We can only modify the custom objects and cannot modify the standard objects as they are part of the Salesforce platform structure.

In the following screenshot, we can see various actions we can take on the custom schema objects.

#### Creating Objects
We can create new objects using the schema builder. Go to the Elements Tab. Drag the element named Object into the canvas. It prompts you to fill in the details of the object.

## Salesforce - Control Access Organization

In an organization, different kinds of data are accessible by different types of users. Salesforce has the mechanism to limit the data access in the platform to both individual users as well as groups of users. There is a flexible but layered sharing model that makes it easy to assign different data sets to different sets of users. Also the access can be defined at the level of organization, objects, fields, or individual records.

### Levels of Data Access
In this section, we will discuss the different levels of Data Access. There are four levels of data access.

#### Organization Level
It is created by maintaining a list of authorized users, setting password policies, and limiting login access to certain hours and certain locations.

#### Objects Level
It is done by setting permission on a particular object by allowing selective viewing, editing or deleting of any object in that record.

#### Fields Level
It is used to restrict access of users to certain fields even when the user has access to the object containing the field.

#### Records Level
This access level permits the user to access only certain records of an object.

-----
## Salesforce - Control Access Fields

There are scenarios in which we grant access to an object to a user but we also want to restrict the access to certain fields of that object. So using field level security, we can control the user's access to see, edit or delete certain fields of an object.

Field level access settings are achieved in two ways −
* Edit a single permission set or profile containing all the fields which require access restriction.
* Edit permission on a single field to be applied in multiple profiles.

### Example
To give edit access to the field DeliverySchedule on the object DeliveryLocations, we go to the permission set named CourierObjects which we created in the last chapter. Then go to the Object settings and choose the object named DeliveryLocations. Click Edit and select the field wherein, we need to set the permission.

To set the field permission for one field across all profiles we open the object through schema builder and then right click on the specific field, choose manage Manage Field Permissions. We will now get the option to set the field permissions for many profiles for this single field.

-----
## Salesforce - Control Access Records
In this chapter, we will learn about the Control Access Records in Salesforce. Many times, beyond the access restriction for the objects and fields, we also need to restrict access to certain records of an object. This requires setting up of access restriction for a user based on the values in the records.

### Record Ownership
A unique feature of Salesforce is the ownership of every stored record. Every record in every object has a field which marks the ownership of that record. A user who needs access to this record becomes part of the profile which is same as the profile of the owner of that record.

### Restriction Mechanism
Access is granted at multiple levels like Object, Field and Records. Conflicts might come up between the access levels. There may be a read access on a record but the object containing it might not have read access for a user. In such case, the access type which is more restrictive (gives less access) will be applied. So a record without access permission will remain inaccessible even when the object containing it is accessible and an Object without access permissions will remain inaccessible even when it has some records to which the user has read access.

### Record Sharing Mechanism
The Saleforce platform provides four distinct mechanisms to share the records of an object with the users.

* Organization-wide defaults
* Manual sharing
* Role hierarchies
* Sharing rules

### Organization-wide defaults
In this mechanism, a minimal access level is created and granted to all the users. So every user who is part of the organization, gets access to these records. Then, the access for additional records is customized by clubbing the users into role hierarchies, sharing rules and also through manual sharing with each of the user.

There are four types of sharing models which implement the organization-wide default settings.

* **Public Read/Write** All users can view, edit, and report on all records.
* **Public Read Only** All users can view and report on records but not edit them. Only the owner, and users above that role in the hierarchy, can edit those records.
* **Private** Only the record owner, and users above that role in the hierarchy, can view, edit, and report on those records.
* **Controlled by Parent** A user can perform an action (such as view, edit, or delete) on a contact based on whether he or she can perform that same action on the record associated with it.

### Manual Sharing
In this access model, the record owners give the read and edit permissions to specific users. So it is a manual process in which individual or group of records are handled by the record owners. This is to be done for each user profile that needs the access.

### Salesforce - Control Access Objects

The access restriction for different objects is managed by using profiles and permissions. The type of access (view, edit, create, etc.) can also customized thorough this mechanism. A user can have only one profile, but can have multiple permission sets. So through profiles the minimum basic permissions for the selected objects is granted while, through permission sets additional permissions beyond the profile can be granted.

Let us now see the details of the profiles creation and granting permission to understand how the object access is managed.

### User Profiles
Profiles are created to address the requirements of a particular business function. For example, the HR department needs a profile which will have access to work history, medical history and attendance of employees. While the finance department will need profile which will access the attendance and remuneration details of an employee. Now depending on the user’s job role, the profile is attached to the user. Only one profile can be allocated for a user.

### Creating a Profile
Go to the link path Setup Home → Users → Profiles. You can see some existing profiles which are pre-built in the salesforce platform. We can create new profiles by cloning the existing profiles and customizing them further based on our requirements.

### User Profiles
Let us now see an existing profile named the standard user. It shows all the types of settings available to this profile. For example, we can set object permissions for both standard objects as well as custom objects. We can also set different administrative permissions and general user permissions and so on.

#### Edit Profile
In order to control the permission to each of the objects through this profile, we can scroll down and find the list of both standard objects and custom objects. Here we can use the check boxes to customize the object access.

#### Assigning a Profile
Once a new profile has been created, it can be assigned to users by going to the link path Setup Home → Users → Users. Now click on the edit to the left of the user name. You will be directed to a new window where in, you can change the profile from the dropdown.


### Permission Sets
Permission sets are additional access given to a user on some objects which are not covered through their profiles. So it just extends users access to some objects based on their profiles. For example, when a new custom object is created, we create a permission set for those objects and attach those permission sets to the users who will need access to those objects. The same logic applies when we want to grant temporary access to specific objects for a user.

#### Creating a Permission Set
We create a permission set by going to the link path Setup Home → Users → Permission Sets. Click on the New button to create a new permission set.

#### Create Permission Set
Once created, we can edit the permission set and choose Object Settings. Here we can see the list of objects and the level of access to these objects. We can edit the access types for each of these objects.

#### Edit Permission Set

## Connected Apps

These are applications that are external to the SalesForce. The user can connect to these apps using the Single-Sign-On.

* **SAML Bearer Assertion Flow**; A signed SAML 2.0 Assertion along with a digital signature can be used to obtain an OAuth access Token
* **OAuth Flow**;
* **Username-password flow**; Used by applications that work without requiring user interactions to actively given authorization
* **User Agent FLow**; CLient side Mobile or Browser application wich cannot secure the client secret
* **JWT Bearer Token FLow**; Server-to-server API integration uses JSON Web Token (JWT) to objection OAuth Access token

** Need to find out more**

A report is a set of records that meets certain criteria which is displayed in organized rows and columns. In a report, you can select columns, filter your data, group, subtotal, and limit your data, conditionally highlight it, embed formulas, display it graphically as a chart, and export it in different formats.
Salesforce provides a strong and intuitive report builder that allows even untrained users to create a report by guiding them through a wizard. The report builder allows you to carry out all the functions related to a report almost visually and makes it very easy for a non-technical user. There are three types of report formats that Salesforce supports:

* **Tabular**: These are the simplest and fastest to build and display data just like how you view in a spreadsheet. They consist of an ordered set of fields in
columns, with each matching record listed in a row, and are best for creating
lists of records or a list with a single grand total. They can't be used to create groups of data or charts, and can't be used in dashboards unless rows
are limited.

* **Summary**: They are similar to tabular reports, but also allow for grouping
rows of data, view subtotals, and create charts. They can be used as the source report for dashboard components. Summary reports with no groupings are shown as tabular reports on the report run page.

* **Matrix**: Similar to summary reports, but more complex and powerful, these
allow you to group and summarize data by both rows and columns. They can also be used as source reports for dashboard components. You can use this report format type for comparing related totals, especially if you have large amounts of data to summarize and you need to compare values in several different fields. Matrix reports without at least one row and one column grouping are shown as summary reports on the report run page.

* **Joined**: These let users view different types of information in a single report. For example, your report could contain Opportunities, Cases, Accounts,
and even Data from custom apps and objects; that is, these reports can
contain data from multiple standard or custom report types, provided they
have relationships with the same object or objects. You can add up to 16
report types, add up to five report blocks, and also create standard and
cross-block custom summary formulas, add a chart, filter individual blocks
using standard and Boolean filters, sort columns for each block, and more.
An example of such a report could be to predict future opportunity revenue
based on your sales reps' past performance, using cross-block custom
summary formulas!
