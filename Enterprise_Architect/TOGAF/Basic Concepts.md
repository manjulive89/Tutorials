### What is TOGAF?

TOGAF is an architecture framework - The Open Group Architecture Framework. TOGAF provides the methods and tools for assisting in the acceptance, production, use, and maintenance of an enterprise architecture. It is based on an iterative process model supported by best practices and a re-usable set of existing architecture assets.

### What is Architecture in the Context of TOGAF?
ISO/IEC 42010:2007 defines "architecture" as:

`"The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution."`

TOGAF embraces but does not strictly adhere to ISO/IEC 42010:2007 terminology. In TOGAF, "architecture" has two meanings depending upon the context:

`"A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at component level to guide its implementation
The structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time"`
