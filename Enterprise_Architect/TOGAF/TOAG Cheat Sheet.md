### What is the TOGAF standard?

TOGAF stands for The Open Group Architectural Framework. It is a tool for assisting in the acceptance, production, use and maintenance of enterprise architectures.  It is based on an iterative process model.

### What is an enterprise according to the TOGAF standard?

The standard defines an “enterprise” as any collection of organisations that have a common set of goals.  Within TOGAF this can be extended to include supply chain partners working with the business to achieve its goals.  For example an online store using a third party distribution centre to store and despatch its orders would include the distribution company within its enterprise.

### What is enterprise architecture according to TOGAF?

The official TOGAF standard doesn’t give a short / concise definition of what they consider to be Enterprise Architecture. I have therefore written the following summary from the Exec Overview of TOGAF which is contained in Part 1 the official Introduction. This follows on from the definition of an Enterprise given above.

The purpose of Enterprise Architecture is to optimise across the enterprise the often fragmented legacy of processes (both manual and automated) into an integrated environment that is responsive to change and supportive of the delivery of the business strategy.

The effective management and use of information through IT is a key factor in succesful leading businesses. An enterprise architecture addresses this requirement by providing a strategic context for the evolution of the IT system in response to the constantly changing needs of the business environment.

A good Enterprise Architecture achieves the right balance between IT efficiency and business innovation. It both allows business units to innovate while maintaining an integrated and cohesive IT strategy enabling the closets possible synergy across the extended enterprise.

### What are the business benefits?

A good Enterprise Architecture will contribute to the profitability of the business / organisation in the following ways:

* A more efficient business operation
  - Lower business operating costs
  - A more agile business
  - Capabilities * will be shared across the business
  - Lower change management costs
* A more flexible workforce
  - Improved business productivity
  - More efficient * IT operation:
  - Lower software development, support and maintenance costs
  - Increased portability of applications
  - Improved interoperability and easier system and network management
  - Improved ability to address critical enterprise -wide issues * like security (and data protection)
  - Easier upgrade and exchange of system components
* Better return on existing investments and reduced risk for future investments
  - Reduced complexity in the business and IT
  - Maximum ROI in existing business and IT infrastructure
  - The flexibility to make, buy or out source business and IT solutions
  - Reduced risk overall in new investments and their cost of ownership
* Faster, simpler and cheaper procurement
  - Buying decisions are simpler because the information governing procurement is readily available in a coherent plan
  - The procurement process is faster – this maximises procurement speed and flexibility without sacrificing architectural coherence
  - The ability to procure heterogeneous multi-vendor open systems
  - The ability to secure more economic capabilities.

### What is “architecture” in the context of the TOGAF standard?

In TOGAF Architecture has two meanings depending on the context:

* Pre-implementation: A formal description of a system or detailed plan of the system at a component level to guide it implementation.

* Post-implementation: The structure of component, their inter-relationship and the principles and guidelines governing their design and its evolution over time.

### What is an architecture framework?

An architecture framework is a foundational structure, or set of structures that can be used for developing a broad range of different architectures. It should describe a method for designing a target state of the enterprise in terms of a set of building blocks and for showing how the blocks fit together. It should also contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary. It should also include a list of recommend standards and compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks.

### Why do I need a framework for enterprise architecture?

In some sectors there are regulatory requirements to follow Enterprise Architecture.  However whatever sector using an architecture framework will:

* speed up and simplify architecture development,
* ensure better if not complete coverage of the design solution
* make certain that the architecture selected allows for future growth and meet the needs of a changing business.

### Why is the TOGAF standard suitable as a framework for enterprise architecture?

* TOGAF has been developed through collaboration of more than 300 Architecture Forum member companies from some of the worlds largest companies.

* The TOGAF standard plays an important role in standardising and risk reduction of the architecture development process

* TOGAF provides a best practice framework for adding value, enabling organisations to build workable and economic solutions addressing their business needs.

* TOGAF results in the delivery of an architecture that is consistent, reflects the news of stakeholders, employs best practice and gives due consideration to current requirements and the perceived future needs of the business.

### What does the TOGAF standard contain?

The key to TOGAF is the method known as the ADM (Architecture Development Method).

The TOGAF standard has 7 sections:

1. Part 1: The introduction: This details the TOGAF approach and defines the terms used throughout the standard.
1. Part 2: The Architecture Development Method (ADM) – the step by step approach to developing an enterprise architecture.
1. Part 3: Guidelines and techniques for use in the ADM
1. Part 4: The Architecture Content Framework
1. Part 5: Enterprise Continuum Tools – This part discusses taxonomies and tools to categorise and store the outputs of architecture activity within an enterprise.
1. Part 6: The TOGAF Reference Models – There are two reference models – a) TOGAF Reference Model (TRF) and b) the Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM)
1. Part 7: The Architecture Capability Framework – This part describes the organisation, processes, skills, roles and responsibilities required to establish an architectural practice within an enterprise.

The ADM (Part 2) is the core. Part III then gives more detailed guidelines and techniques used by the ADM.

The ADM process produces content which needs to be stored in the Enterprise Architecture repository. The repository structure is documented in part 4, the ACF (Architecture Content Framework). This in turn classifies the content using the taxonomy from Part V, the Enterprise Continuum and Tools.  At the start of a project the content repository will initially be loaded with one of the reference models described in part VI, the TOGAF Reference Models.

The ACF (Part VII) describes how to set-up an architectural practice to operate the ADM.

### What are the different types of architecture that the TOGAF standard deals with?

1. Business Architecture: The business strategy, governance, organisation and key business processes.

1. Data Architecture: The structure of an organisations logical and physical data assets and data management resources.

1. Application Architecture: A blueprint for the individual application systems to be deployed, their interactions and their relationships to the core business processes of the organisation.

1. Technology Architecture: The software and hardware capabilities that are required to support the deployment of business, data and application services. This includes IT infrastructure, middleware, networks, comms, processing and standards.

### What are the TOGAF ADM phase names and the purpose of each phase?

1. Preliminary Phase
1. Phase A: Architecture Vision
1. Phase B: Business Architecture
1. Phase C: Information Systems Architecture
1. Phase D: Technology Architecture
1. Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions
1. Phase F: Migration Planning
1. Phase G: Implementation Governance
1. Phase H: Architecture Change Management
1. Requirements Management: this is the process for managing architectural requirements throughout the ADM.

### Provide a high-level overview of ADM

* The Prilimary phase provides the overall view of stakeholders, scope of the enterprise, and architecture principals.
the requirments for the `Architecture Project`, Most importanlty deffines the `goal` it also defined the SOW, Communication plan, Project Plan, Architecture Capabilities, team memebers. It mainly defines the `Architectural Project Requirments`. This requirement is refered to as `Statement for Architectural Work` (this is exaclty like SOW but it is SAW)
* Phase A Defines the Scope of the work, estimate resources, budget, roadmap and schedules, PKI and metrics, and Communication Plan. this is excalty like a Project management approach. It identifies the new capabilites to be delivered and the business value it provides. Also to Obtain approval for the `Statement for Architectural Work`.
* The Phase B translates the architectural gaols and requirments to business requirments. Define the baseline, and target architecture and the gaps in the business process. and possibly associate any requirments from the Requirment Phase.
* The Phase C translates the Gaps from the Pahse B into application and data requirments, define the baseline, and target architecutrue and gaps at the application and data level.
* Phase D translates the gaps from the Phase C into the requirments from phase C and add any requirments from the Requirments Phase. It defines the baseline and  target architecture into the gaps at the technology level.
* Phase E analyse the Gaps from the Phase C and D and possibly the Phase B into a solution. this solution will be working with Solutions Architecture.
* Phase F is the delivery of the design and solutions fromthe Phase E.
* Phase G ensure and supervise the implementation of the solution and make sure they are fully inline with the defined solutions.
* Phase H ensure the architecture capabilites,

### What are the TOGAF deliverables, artefacts, and building blocks?

The Architecture Content Framework uses the following three categories to describe the type of architectural work products:

1. Deliverables: A work product that the project is contractually required to produce.
1. Artefact: A work product this is just an aspect of the overall architecture. These are generally catalogues (lists of things), diagrams and matrices (showing the relationship between things). Examples include a requirements catalogue and Use Case diagrams.
1. Building Blocks: These represent potentially re-usable components of business, IT or architectural capability. These can be combined with other building blocks to deliver architectural solutions.
There are two types of Building Blocks:

  - ABB (Architecture Building Blocks) – these describe the required capability.

  - SBB (Solution Building Blocks) – These represent components to be used to implement the required capability.


### What is the TOGAF Enterprise Continuum?

Here is the definition from the TOGAF 9 Part V (Enterprise Continuum and Tools)

The Enterprise Continuum provides a view of the Architecture Repository that shows the evolution of these related architectures from generic to specific, from abstract to concrete and from logical to physical.

### What is the TOGAF Architecture Repository?

This is a structure for storing all the outputs of the ADM. The major components within the structure of the repository are:

1. Architecture Metamodel:
1. Architecture Capability
1. Architecture Landscape: What building blocks are in use in the organisation today.
1. Standards Information Base (SIB): Standards internal and external that the architecture and solution must comply with.
1. Reference Library: Contains guidelines, templates, patterns and other references materials that can be leveraged.
1. Governance Log: A record of governance activities across the enterprise.

### How to establish and operate an enterprise architecture capability?

The TOGAF standard recommends that an Enterprise Architecture practice should be run like an other operational unit within a business and it should therefore be treated like a business.  On that basis the architectural practice will need to establish the following capabilities:

* Financial Management
* Performance Management
* Service Management
* Risk Management
* Resource Management
* Communication and Stakeholder Management
* Quality Management
* Supplier Management
* Configuration Management
* Environment Management
* Architectural Goverenace – this being key and the benefits include:
  - Clarity of accountability and informed delegation of authority
  - Controlled risk management
  - Protection of the existing asset base through maximising re-use of existing architectural components
  - Proactive control, monitoring and management processes
  - Process, concept, and component re-use across all business units.
  - Value creation through monitoring, evaluation and feedback
  - Increased visibility supporting internal processes and external partners. A key example being visibility of decision making at lower levels in the business which could have far reaching strategic implications.
  - Great shareholder value; in particular enterprise architecture increasinly represents core IPR. There is evidence that the most profitable businesses have well governed enterprises.
  - Integrates with existing process and methodologies and complements functionality bu adding control capabilities.

### How to use the TOGAF framework with other frameworks?

* TOGAF is a generic framework intended to be used in a wide variety of environments.
* TOGAF provides a flexible and extensible content framework that underpins a set of generic architectural deliverables
* TOGAF can be used on its own or merged with other frameworks that are more specific to the operating environment.
* In ALL cases it is expected that the architect will tailor TOGAF to integrate into the processes and organisation structure of the enterprise.
* Tailoring may include integrating methods from ITIL, CMMI, COBIT, PRINCE2, PMBOK and MSP.
* As TOGAF is a generic framework it also complements vertical specific frameworks such as security and e-Commence.

### What is the TOGAF ADM cycle?

The ADM diagram above is carefully drawn to try and make it clear that the ADM supports an iterative approach at three levels:

* Cycling around the ADM i.e. A to H several times.
* Between phases: For example from Technology Architecture back to Business Architecture.
* Around a single phase: For example iterating around a single phase as a technique for elaborating the architectural content.


* `Architecture Capablity Iteralion` The Prilimary phase and Architecture Vision (Phase A) sets the goals and defiens  the Architecture project plan.
* `Architecture Development Iteraltion` The Phase B, C, and D is manily development phase that develop the detailed approach to the Architectural Model
* Transition Planning` is consist of Phase E and E. this is where the design is implemented. Generally Phase E is where solution architecti is involved and Phase F is when project management is involved.
* `Governance Iteration` are Phase G and H, deals with ensuring the implementation is compliant and fully aligned with the EA goals.

### What are the typical sets of steps within a phase?

* Input
* Steps
* Output

Generally high level the Steps B, C, D mainly deals with

* Identify the baseline (AS-IS) architecture
* Identify the target (TO-Be) architecture
* Identify the GAP between baseline andd target architecture

### What are the Common inputs for all phases

1. external refrence materials
2. Request for Architectural work (Created are Prim Phase)
3. Business principlas goal, and drivers (Created are Prim Phase)
4. Organization Model for EA (Created are Prim Phase)
5. Tailored Architecture Framework (Created are Prim Phase)
6. Populated Architecture Repository (Created are Prim Phase)


### What are the Architecture Partitioning

There are three layers to the EA architectrue

* `Strategic Architecture`: Generally these are the `stakeholder's concerns` associated with top exuctivies.
* `Segmented Architecture`: Generally these are partial architectural models, they may be drived from the busines goals, some of the business golas may also be drived from the `stakeholders concerns` they should be fully inline with the strategic
* `Capabilites Architecture`: these are capabilities level, they may be initiated from the requirent phase (The middle circle). These should be fully inline with both Strategic and Segemented architecture.
