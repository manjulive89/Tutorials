# TOGAF Key Terms
* `Activity`: A task or collection of tasks that support the functions of an organization; for example, a user entering data into an IT system or traveling to visit customers.

* `Application` :A deployed and operational IT system that supports business functions and services; for example, a payroll. Applications use data and are supported by multiple technology components but are distinct from the technology components that support the application.

* `Application Architecture` : A description of the major logical grouping of capabilities that manage the data objects necessary to process the data and support the business.

* `Building Block` :Represents a (potentially re-usable) component of business, IT, or architectural capability that can be combined with other building blocks to deliver architectures and solutions.

* `Architecture Building Block (ABB)` :A constituent of the architecture model that describes a single aspect of the overall model.

* `Business Architecture` :The business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes information, as well as the interaction between these concepts.

* `Architecture Principles` :A qualitative statement of intent that should be met by the architecture. Has at least a supporting rationale and a measure of importance.

* `Architecture Continuum` :A part of the Enterprise Continuum. A repository of architectural elements with increasing detail and specialization. This Continuum begins with foundational definitions such as reference models, core strategies, and basic building blocks. From there it spans to Industry Architectures and all the way to an organization’s specific architecture.

* `Architecture Development Method (ADM)` :The core of TOGAF. A step-by-step approach to develop and use an enterprise architecture.

* `Architecture Domain` :The architectural area being considered. There are four architecture domains within TOGAF: Business, Data, Application, and Technology.

* `Architecture Framework` :A foundational structure, or set of structures, which can be used for developing a broad range of different architectures. It should contain a method for designing an information system in terms of a set of building blocks, and for showing how the building blocks fit together. It should contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary. It should also include a list of recommended standards and compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks.

* `Architecture View` : A view is a representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. A view is what you see (or what a stakeholder sees). Views are specific.

* `Architecture Viewpoint`: where you are looking from; the vantage point or perspective. Viewpoints are generic. A model (or description) of the information contained in a view.

* `Architecture Vision` : A high-level, aspirational view of the Target Architecture. / A phase in the ADM which delivers understanding and definition of the Architecture Vision /Level of granularity of work to be done.

* `Baseline` :A specification that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon, that thereafter serves as the basis for further development or change and that can be changed only through formal change control procedures or a type of procedure such as configuration management.

* `Baseline Architecture` :The existing defined system architecture before entering a cycle of architecture review and redesign.

* `Business Governance` :Concerned with ensuring that the business processes and policies (and their operation) deliver the business outcomes and adhere to relevant business regulation.

* `Capability` :An ability that an organization, person, or system possesses. Capabilities are typically expressed in general and high-level terms and typically require a combination of organization, people, processes, and technology to achieve; or example, marke`ting, customer contact, or outbound telemarketing.

* `Concerns` :The key interests that are crucially important to the stakeholders in a system, and determine the acceptability of the system. Concerns may pertain to any aspect of the system’s functioning, development, or operation, including considerations such as performance, reliability, security, distribution, and evolvability. Longer lasting than problem (eg. state of the economy), not a requirement, which is short term.

* `Enterprise` : The highest level (typically) of description of an organization and typically covers all missions and functions. An enterprise will often span multiple organizations.

* `A "pattern"` has been defined as: "an idea that has been useful in one practical context and will probably be useful in others" [Analysis Patterns - Re-usable Object Models].
