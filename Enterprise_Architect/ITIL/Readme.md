# What is ITIL

There are 5 stages of ITIL lifecycle:

* Service Strategy,
* Service Design,
* Service Transition,
* Service Operation and
* Continual Service Improvement.

 They form the perfect ITIL Service Management plan. Each stage covers different content and the ITIL process that needs to be in place for the operations within each stage to work properly. Without the ITIL process and accompanying content, the stage is likely to fail and all the other stages will crumble down with it.

 It is important that the IT service manager is knowledgeable about each ITIL process and that the service owner knows how to implement each of the stagesâ€™ processes as he ultimately takes ownership of the service and its lifecycle. Aspects of roles and responsibilities such as the service owner are covered in the ITIL Foundation Certification course.
