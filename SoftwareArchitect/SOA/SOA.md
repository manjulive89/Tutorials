# SOA

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has several core ideas that should be addressed in your organization's SOA journey:

* A set of services that a business wants to provide to their customers, partners, or other areas of an organization
* An architectural style that requires a service provider, mediation, and service requestor with a service description
* A set of architectural principles, patterns and criteria that address characteristics such as modularity, encapsulation, loose coupling, separation of concerns, reuse and composability
* A programming model complete with standards, tools and technologies that supports web services, REST services or other kinds of services
* A middleware solution optimized for service assembly, orchestration, monitoring, and management

With the convergence of mobile, social, cloud, and big data analytics, SOA is more important than ever before for offering insight and integrating systems from end to end. By applying Service Oriented Architecture principles, an enterprise can manage and govern business and IT transformation, setting them apart from their competitors. The benefits range from seamless integration, cloud enabled solutions, holistic business insight and agility to externalized APIs. SOA integrates the front office, back office and the Internet of Things.

Middleware, best practices and patterns speed the Service Oriented Architecture journey and amplify the value it creates. IBM has over a decade of experience with SOA and a broad portfolio of capabilities, spanning integration, processes, operational control and services. SOA is “simply good design" — resting on a solid foundation of technology and practices that support your organization’s journey into the changing world of mobile, social, cloud and big data.
