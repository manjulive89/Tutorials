# Big Data


## Big Data Characteristics
The followings are the 4 V's of big data.

* `Volume` : The quantity of generated and stored data. Generally big data deals with larg volume of data. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight, and whether it can be considered big data or not.

* `Variety` : The type and nature of the data. The data can be composed of staructured, semi-structured, or none structured data. This helps people who analyze it to effectively use the resulting insight. Big data draws from text, images, audio, video; plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion.

* `Velocity` : The speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development. Big data is often available in real-time. Compared to small data, big data are produced more continually. Two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling, recording, and publishing.

* `Veracity` : It is the extended definition for big data, which refers to the data quality and the data value. The data quality of captured data can vary greatly, affecting the accurate analysis.

In summary the big data deals with larg volumes of data, the can be composed of staructured, semi-structured, or none structured data. that are generated and must be processed rapidely. there may be some data cleasning and validate or varification required.
